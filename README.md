# Life-Expectancy-Prediction

## Project Title: Life Expectancy Prediction with Machine Learning

Introduction

In this project, our objective is to develop a Linear Regression model capable of accurately predicting life expectancy. To accomplish this, we will utilize a comprehensive dataset initially sourced from reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations. The dataset encompasses a wide range of informative features including the year of observation, the socioeconomic status of countries, life expectancy, adult mortality rates, infant deaths, expenditure percentages, and alcohol consumption etc. By employing this dataset and leveraging the power of Linear Regression, we aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing life expectancy and construct a reliable predictive model.

The project consisted of the following key steps, each contributing to the success of our endeavor:

1. Data Collection: We gathered a comprehensive dataset containing relevant information such as healthcare, GDP, education, and more, essential for analyzing the factors influencing life expectancy.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: By performing data exploration and visualization techniques, we identified patterns, outliers, and correlations within the dataset, gaining valuable insights into the data.

3. Data Preparation: We divided the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model's performance could be evaluated accurately.

4. Model Training: Utilizing Scikit-learn, we trained a Linear Regression model on the training data, allowing it to learn the relationships between the input features and the target variable (life expectancy).

5. Model Evaluation: We assessed the trained model's performance by comparing its predictions on the testing data with the actual life expectancy values, employing appropriate evaluation metrics.

By following this systematic approach, we successfully developed a reliable model for life expectancy prediction.
By engaging in this project, we acquired practical knowledge in implementing machine learning techniques, thereby enhancing our comprehension of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes. This endeavor not only bolsters our skill set but also aligns with the overarching objective of leveraging machine learning for impactful applications in healthcare.
