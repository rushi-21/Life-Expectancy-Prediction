# Life-Expectancy-Prediction

## Project Title: Life Expectancy Prediction with Machine Learning

Introduction

In this project, our objective is to develop a Linear Regression model capable of accurately predicting life expectancy. To accomplish this, we will utilize a comprehensive dataset initially sourced from reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations. The dataset encompasses a wide range of informative features including the year of observation, the socioeconomic status of countries, life expectancy, adult mortality rates, infant deaths, expenditure percentages, and alcohol consumption etc. By employing this dataset and leveraging the power of Linear Regression, we aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing life expectancy and construct a reliable predictive model.
